# Personal Website Project Documentation

# MOST IMPORTANT THING:
Implement only one feature at a time (even if you have multiple features) so that:
1. Each feature can be properly tested before moving to the next
2. Changes are more manageable and easier to track
3. If any issues arise, it's easier to identify which change caused them
4. We can prioritize features based on importance
5. We can make adjustments to the implementation strategy based on feedback from each feature

# Before starting to implement any feature, the following things should be done:
1. Check if there is any existing similar feature
2. Check if any existing feature can be reused
3. Check if the feature is already implemented (if it's not, it should be implemented first)

## Project Overview
A modern, responsive personal website built with React.js, featuring various tools and sections including a powerful PDF Merger tool.

## Tech Stack
- React.js 18.2.0
- Tailwind CSS
- pdf-lib (PDF manipulation)
- pdfjs-dist (PDF rendering)
- @dnd-kit/core & @dnd-kit/sortable (Drag and drop)
- create-react-app with CRACO configuration
