# Compliance Calendar Enhancement Plan

## User Instructions
IMPORTANT - After each feature is implemented, please update this file. Add "Complete" at the end of each feature.

1. We shall give a separate login for each of our clients - In progress (See Project_Notes.md for more details)
2. Each client will have a separate set of compliance tasks.
3. We need to display the compliance tasks in the compliance calendar based on which client has logged in.
4. When the user clicks on any compliance task, a separate task page should open to display all the relevant information about the compliance task.
5. The task page should have the following information:
    a. Compliance Period (Financial Year, Quarter or Month)
    b. Area of Compliance (Accounting, Payroll, TDS, GST, PT, Income Tax, Reporting & Analysis)
    c. Task Name (This is the header of the task page)
    d. Task Description (This is the description of the task)
    e. Action Month (The month in which the task needs to be completed)
    f. Action Date (The date by which the task needs to be completed. This is more applicable for tasks which don't have a due date as per the law)
    g. Due Date (The date date of the task as per the law)
    h. Remarks Text Field (Any remarks or notes related to the task to be typed in by the user)
    i. Task Status Dropdown (Open, In Progress, Due, Complete)
    j. Supporting Documents (Upload feature)
6. I guess we need to create a database for this purpose.
    a. The database should have many tables. Please suggest the required tables and we can decide what tables to create
    b. We need to upload supporting documents for each file. Let me know how to do it.
7. The tasks in the calendar view should be coloured based on the task status. The task status can be
    a. Open - Due date is later than the current date and the task is not complete (Blue color)
    b. Due - Due date is before the current date and task is not started (Red color)
    c. In Progress - The user has manually selected the task as in progress (Orange color)
    d. Complete - The user has manually selected the task as complete (Green color)
