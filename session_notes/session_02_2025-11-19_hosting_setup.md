## Completed Tasks

- Added `vercel.json` for SPA routing support.
- Verified build locally.
- User configured custom domain `srinidhibs.com` and verified DNS propagation.

## Next Steps
- **Phase 2: Content Pages**: Start implementing the content pages (Home, Finance, Trading, Travel).
- The project is now live at `srinidhibs.com`.

## Notes
