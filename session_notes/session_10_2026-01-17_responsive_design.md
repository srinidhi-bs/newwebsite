# Session 10: Responsive Design Fixes

## Date: 2026-01-17
## Task: Task 3.1 (Responsive Design Audit & Fixes)

## Completed Work
- **Layout Fixes**: Updated `PageWrapper` with increased top padding (`pt-24`) to prevent content from being hidden behind the fixed header. Added `overflow-x-hidden` to preventing horizontal scrolling issues.
- **Home Page**: Adjusted typography for mobile (smaller Hero text) and optimized vertical spacing.
- **Trading Page**: 
  - Fixed `min-height` calculation to account for header.
  - Reduced animation entry offsets on mobile to prevent overflow.
- **Finance Page**: Improved tab navigation layout on smaller screens to allow wrapping.

## Next Steps
- **Task 3.2**: Enhanced Dark Mode Implementation.
  - Review color contrast in dark mode.
  - Ensure all components have proper dark variants.
  - Fix any flashing issues on load.
